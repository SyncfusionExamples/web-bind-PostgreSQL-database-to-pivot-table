# How to bind PostgreSQL database to a Pivot Table

A quick start project for connecting a PostgreSQL database to a Syncfusion Pivot Table. This repository includes a Web API Controller ([MyWebService](../MyWebService/)) for retrieving data from a PostgreSQL database, as well as a quick start sample in the JavaScript platform that displays the retrieved data in a Pivot Table.
